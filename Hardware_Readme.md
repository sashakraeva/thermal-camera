## Overview

This project combines a thermal camera and an ESP32 to capture and analyze thermal data and distance measurements. It was developed as part of the **YAKISUGI Torch Project**, a system designed to optimize and standardize the traditional Japanese wood-burning technique for enhanced durability, pest resistance, and waterproofing. 

**About the YAKISUGI Method:**
The YAKISUGI method is a traditional Japanese wood preservation technique that involves charring the surface of the wood with fire. This process results in increased durability, pest resistance, and waterproofing.

**Objective and Motivation:**
- Optimize the wood-burning process by providing visual feedback, measurements, and real-time data.
- Preserve and modernize this ancestral technique for artisans and robotic systems.
- Enable interaction between digital devices and artisans, informing future designs for robotic systems.

The thermal camera streams real-time data, allowing users to select a Region of Interest (ROI), while the ESP32 provides proximity data. The script integrates both sources of information, displays them on an interactive interface, and saves them to a CSV file.

**Main Features:**

- Real-time thermal data processing.
- Integration with an ESP32 for distance measurement.
- Interactive user interface for ROI selection.
- Data logging of temperature and distance values.
- Preservation of the YAKISUGI technique through standardized and optimized burning processes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following are installed:

- **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** or later.
- **Python 3.7** or newer.
- **Compatible Thermal Camera** (e.g., FLIR USB camera).

### Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip3 install numpy opencv-python requests
```

Additional system libraries might be needed depending on your thermal camera:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libuvc-dev
```

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository-url.git
cd your-repository-folder
```

2. Verify your ESP32 is set up and running with its provided firmware.

   - The ESP32 should serve distance data on a network-accessible IP (default: `http://192.168.4.1`).

3. For additional guidance on using the thermal camera, refer to the repository developed for this purpose: [Thermal Camera GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Clarrainl/thermal-camera).

## Usage

### Selecting ROI

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python3 thermal_camera_esp32.py
   ```

2. The live feed from the thermal camera will appear.

3. Press `s` to select the Region of Interest (ROI):

   - Use your mouse to drag and select a rectangular area.
   - This area will be analyzed for temperature data.

### Running the Script

- Once the ROI is selected, the script will:

  - Continuously process thermal data within the ROI.
  - Query the ESP32 for distance measurements.
  - Display the maximum and minimum temperatures, as well as the distance, in real-time.

- Press `q` at any time to exit the program.

### Saving Data

- The script logs temperature and distance data at regular intervals (default: every 5 seconds).
- After exiting, you will be prompted to save the data to a CSV file:
  - Example output file: `temperature_distance_data.csv`.
